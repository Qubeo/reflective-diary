\label{indicators}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\note{An aspect of teaching that can be observed directly.}

\section*{Quantitative indicators}

Time management\\
\note{How much longer/shorter was the lesson compared to the plan?\\
How long did I talk? How long were students actively engaged?\\
What was the mean time I spent with a single student?}

Student interaction\\
\note{How many questions have I asked? Were they open- or close-ended?\\
How many questions did I get? How many was I able to answer?\\
How many students did I (verbally) praise/reward for good work?}

Work on exercises\\
\note{How many exercises did students solve during the lecture?\\
How many students got lost in the tasks? How many were bored?}

Attandence\\
\note{How many students attended the lecture? How many were late?\\
How many students left during the lecture?}

\section*{Qualitative indicators}

Feelings and subjective satisfaction\\
\note{What feelings did I have during the lecture?\\
How did the students behave? Were they attentive/active?\\
Am I a good role model for the students?}

Lecture structure\\
\note{Did the studets know, what to do, how to do it and why?\\
Did I follow the planned schedule? If not, why?}

Lecture content\\
\note{Is my teaching diverse enough (task types, tools, \dots)?\\
Does my contents match the learning goals I want to reach?}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Remember (\textit{knowledge})}\\
\note{facts and terminology, classification and categorization thereof}\\
{\small define, list, repeat, describe, identify, reproduce, recognize}

\item \textbf{Understand (\textit{comprehension})}\\
\note{reformulation, simple interpretation and extrapolation}\\
{\small rewrite, extend, explain, paraphrase, summarize, give example, illustrate on an example}

\item \textbf{Apply (\textit{usage})}\\
\note{applying the method in the right situation, abstracting and generalizing}\\
{\small carry out, apply, manipulate, demonstrate, implement, solve a model problem}

\item \textbf{Analyze (\textit{decomposition})}\\
\note{decomposition into basic blocks, relations and interactions between them}\\
{\small discuss, \enquote{break} into smaller parts, compare and contrast, design/select a solution, deconsruct, interconnect}

\item \textbf{Evaluate (\textit{judgements})}\\
\note{assessment based on set criteria and standards}\\
{\small evaluate, conclude, test, assess, ctiticize, justify}

\item \textbf{Create (\textit{synthesis})}\\
\note{creating a new product, reorganization into a new structure}\\
{\small generate, modify, rearrange, invent, design, budovat, compose}
\end{enumerate}

\note{Level boundaries are not strict. The list of actions can help you describe the learning goals/objectvives and knowledge/skills the students should gain. It can indicate how diverse your teaching is.}
