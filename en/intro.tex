\chapter*{How does one become a good teacher?}

\vspace*{1em}
Let's pose a dynamic question instead of a static one:

\vspace*{1em}
\textit{\large \enquote{What can you do to improve your teaching skills?}}

\vspace*{1em}
Three things seem to be necessary (and probably sufficient) for improvement\punct{.}\footnotemark
\footnotetext{There are also other useful things (such as expert feedback), but those do not scale very well.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Teaching regularly.}\\You need your own teaching experience, ideally on a regular basis.
\item \textbf{Reflecting your teaching.}\\Pay attention to what worked well and what should you change for the future.
\item \textbf{Observing the teaching of others.}\\Think about what other teachers do, what works for them, what does not and what can you adopt.
\end{enumerate}

This diary will help you reflect your own teaching. It suggests things to pay attention to, questions to ask and aspects to ponder. But bear in mind -- it's not a cookbook for good teaching, it is only a guidebook for your own journey.

To supplement your teaching reflection, join the conversation with your fellow teachers. Ask around at your institution for a teaching and learning center or directly engage your colleagues teaching the same course.

\section*{How to use the reflective diary?}

First and foremost, use it regularly.

Note down your thoughts both when planning the lecture and after delivering it. There are thirteen page spreads (one for each semester week), each suggesting a handful of questions. The diary is quite small -- it's partly to keep your notes short.

After the page spreads for individual weeks, there is a rubric for teaching skills, a list of indicators that can be evaluated, a list of some useful teaching tools and some extra space for your notes and remarks.

\section*{Why to use the reflective diary?}

Regularly using the reflective diary serves multiple purposes:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt]
\item It reminds you to reflect your teaching.
\item It provides you with a convenient place to collect notes for the future.
\item It helps you see all the different aspects of teaching.
\item It enables you to track your progress.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Having any comments or suggestions?}

We highly appreciate suggestions for improvement, notes on your experience or any other comments. Please email Martin at \textit{mukrop@mail.muni.cz.}
